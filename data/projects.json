This was the second iteration for this series of products, it changed and develop in a more mature version from the original demo release created for the Evos Microscope. We created from scratch a training system (Unity state machine) that was able to create a sequence of steps. It was a client requirement that users could switch between steps, so our state machine was build in order to properly store all the steps within a module. This state machine was used and updated within all iterations for the DSS series.",

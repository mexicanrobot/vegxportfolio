Qubit Flex Digital Smart Star 3D Web Training

Digital Smart Star (DSS) was a new experience created for Thermofisher to show our customers a new way of understanding purchased equipment.

This 3D web experience’s purpose is to train Thermofisher customers in how to use, install and run and experiment with the Qubit Flex without the help of any technician on the site. Thus saving money for the company and adding an interactive and innovative experience to customers.

Quantstudio 3 and 5  Digital Smart Star 3D Web Training 

After creating multiple iterations of the DSS and from user feedback we innovate a new way to show our customer a more interactive and user-friendly way to train. From testing and making field research we came with a new solution to completely re-design the DSS series.

Swapportunity zap your competition!

This VR game was developed to solve a common problem within the Sales business: Training.
Inside the game, a sales representative will learn while playing in a virtual world, created from real lab photo references.
Three labs were developed for training: Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, and Protein Biology. The goal is for the user to look around the lab and find equipment and then swap it out with the Thermofisher equivalent.
This game was showcased in February at the annual Sales conference from Fisher Sci hosted in Florida. It was a total success at the expo! We had multiple people at the time playing the game, and got very positive feedback from it, even from the competition, who also played our game.

Continuous Manufacturing Project

A prototype project for Thermo Fisher Scientific’s Pharma Services Group.
Based on photographic and photogrammetry data provided, an optimized reproduction of a real pharmaceutical manufacturing facility was created, this is to be used on mixed reality platforms for a further population with instruments that could have a training intent inside the Hololens.

The goal of this prototype was to showcase customers the facility without them actually visiting the real-life site, this was done due to COVID 19 pandemic safe distance restrictions.

I model this back when I was a student as homework but never texture the mesh. I did this small project to polish my substance texturing skills.

I created this project to test out Unity's HDRP and my Real-Time Render Skills
At first, the water was going to be Unity Shader, I build one with the Shader Graph but in the end, I did not like the result. Thus I switch to a more simple and cartoon material.
On the marmoset toolbag viewer, I made the water more transparent so the rock could be more visible.

Bakery Shop

I created this project using a stylized workflow.
Was really fun giving detail to some parts such as the bricks, logs wood, and so on Zbrush.
Some materials were done from scratch by me using a designer and painter.
Again I used HDRender Pipeline from unity for this model to keep improving my Real-Time Rendering skills.
